# Contributing to Project Meridian Blog

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to Project Meridian Blog. This guide will help you get started with creating and publishing content.

## üìù Writing Articles

### Article Format

Articles are written in MDX format (Markdown with JSX support) and stored in `src/content/articles/`.

### Creating a New Article

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/content/articles/`
2. Name it using kebab-case: `my-article-title.mdx`
3. Add the required frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Article Title"
description: "A brief description of your article (150-160 characters)"
publishDate: 2024-01-15
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["technology", "innovation", "best-practices"]
draft: false
image:
  src: "/images/article-cover.jpg"
  alt: "Description of the image"
---

Your article content goes here...
```

### Frontmatter Schema

- **title** (required): The article title
- **description** (required): Brief summary for SEO and preview cards
- **publishDate** (required): Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **author** (required): Author name
- **tags** (required): Array of relevant tags
- **draft** (optional): Set to `true` to hide from production
- **image** (optional): Cover image with src and alt text

### Content Guidelines

1. **Use clear, descriptive headings** - Start with H2 (`##`) for main sections
2. **Include code examples** when relevant:
   ```typescript
   const example = "Use syntax highlighting";
   ```
3. **Add images** to the `public/images/` directory
4. **Link internally** using relative paths: `[Other Article](/articles/other-article)`
5. **Keep paragraphs concise** - Aim for 3-4 sentences per paragraph

## üåø Branch Strategy

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b article/your-article-name
   ```

2. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add article: Your Article Title"
   ```

3. **Push and create a PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin article/your-article-name
   ```

- [ ] Images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Article renders correctly locally (`npm run dev`)

## üöÄ Local Development

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
