        Finding Your Meridian

          In navigation, the meridian line represents true northâ€”not magnetic north, but the unchanging reference point that guides you home. For leaders and organizations, we are that meridian.

            "'Best practice' has become code for 'how everyone else does it.' We challenge leaders to move beyond the comfortable consensus toward what's actually right."

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 dark:text-gray-100">The Status Quo Problem</h2>
        <p class="text-lg dark:text-gray-300">
          "Best practice" sounds smart, doesn't it? But here's the thingâ€”it's often just a fancy way of saying "this is how everyone else does it." The problem isn't that these practices are wrong, it's that they've become default answers to complex questions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg dark:text-gray-300">
          Like a compass pointing to magnetic north instead of true north, following best practices can leave you slightly off course. Close enough to feel right, but not quite where you need to be.
        </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 dark:text-gray-100">Question the Given</h3>
            <p class="dark:text-gray-300">When someone says "that's just how it's done," we ask "but is it how it should be done?" The most dangerous phrase in leadership isn't "we've never done it that way"â€”it's "everyone else does it this way."</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 dark:text-gray-100">Context Over Convention</h3>
            <p class="dark:text-gray-300">What works for Google might not work for your 50-person startup. What works in Silicon Valley might not work in small-town Ohio. We help you find your right way, not the popular way.</p>

            <p class="dark:text-gray-300">Your meridian isn't found in industry reports or competitor analysisâ€”it's found in your values, your purpose, and your unique context. We help you calibrate your compass to your true north.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 dark:text-gray-100">Why It Matters Now</h2>
        <p class="text-lg dark:text-gray-300">
          We're living through a time when the old playbooks aren't working. Remote work, AI, changing generational values, global uncertaintyâ€”the "best practices" that got us here might not get us there.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg dark:text-gray-300">
          This blog is where we explore what comes next. Where we challenge sacred cows, question obvious answers, and help leaders find their meridian in an increasingly complex world.
